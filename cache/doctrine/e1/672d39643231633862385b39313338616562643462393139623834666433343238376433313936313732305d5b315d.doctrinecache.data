        <p>The Subutai Blockchain Router is a power-efficient, “green” broadband Cloud router and open hardware IoT gateway. It serves as a plug-and-play cryptocurrency wallet and mining device that allows users to easily enter the cryptocurrency economy. Using just 18W (standalone; 60W with additional Mining Drives), the Subutai Blockchain Router is eco-friendly, cost-effective, and 1,000-2,000%+ more energy efficient for the same hash rate over traditional GPU-based mining devices —a critically important consideration in today’s energy-aware environment.</p>
