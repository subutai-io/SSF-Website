<h1>Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud Computing</h1>
</div>
</div>
<section class="container">
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>P2P is all about sharing, and sharing is a social activity. Sharing, in even small groups, has its advantages. However sharing en masse could lead to amazing achievements. Socialized computing services where you contribute resources to participate could have a profound impact on our lives and on the way we use the Internet.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Content Distribution</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>Content distribution as a collective service is already possible with Subutai. Environment templates, Debian packages, or just about any kind of file, for common infrastructure or for your applications are distributable via P2P file sharing across peers. Subutai's CDN (content distribution network) lets you publicly publish, or privately share files using global or exclusive swarms respectively.The verified site and content hosting service built into the Subutai Bazaar allows for safe content distribution across peers dynamically based on where on the Internet that data is needed most.​ Currently we're researching ways to go a step further. We have been looking at providing generalized content distribution in the form of a distributed file system. We are investigating the integration of various file systems which could adapt well to the P2P model like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Collective Cyber Defense</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>Socially, security exists in society and among nations. Why can't people collaborating across peer networks be able to benefit as well? We already enable sharing of threat information and offer dynamic sharing to provide defensive capabilities against DDoS. Subutai PeerOS has built-in analytics to detect fraud and cyber threats. The Subutai Bazaar offers additional free services to enhance the analytics and diagnostics needed to detect bottlenecks and threats. Subutai running on accelerated Blockchain Routers also assists in detection and countermeasures. In the future we would like to take a big step in cybersecurity: we are working on a legal framework and protocol to enable offensive capabilities to defend against attackers and make the Internet a safer place. Attacking one of us, triggers an attack by the entire horde.</p>

    <h2>Use Case: Be Your Own Micro Cloud Provider</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>By using P2P technologies to combine resources on computers, Subutai already provides an infrastructure as a service cloud environment. Subutai users can create cloud environments effectively appearing as virtual data centers. The more computing resources you throw into your peer[s] and the number of peers supporting your environment, the bigger the virtual data center. Scaling a peer with more resources and scaling the number of peers themselves give Subutai its elastic cloud capabilities. Higher level infrastructure services are built on this such as an S3 compatible clone. Subutai aims to model and implement as many Amazon compatible services as possible.</p>
        <p>AppScale has been integrated with Subutai to provide a Google App Engine (GAE)-compatible PaaS layer. Applications written and deployed to GAE can also be run on Subutai with the AppScale plugin. That means you can write PHP, Python, Java, and Go based GAE applications to run on Subutai while distributing the application on peers across the Internet.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Use Case: Virtual Office</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>for distributed startup teams and SME's with multiple branch offices. Not only do you tie people and SOHO offices together, but you enable them with common back-office and productivity applications they need. Native built-in social cloud services and the AppScale based PaaS layer can be utilized to quickly build your ultimate application on Subutai.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Use Case: Virtual Electronics and IoT Laboratory</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>We love electronics and writing applications for gadgets on the edge. The only problem is having instant access to them or the tools for working with them. We've envisioned using Subutai to set up virtual laboratories where these devices and various tools could be shared to increase the rate of development of software and hardware. We think such a system could especially benefit those students in universities and talented entrepreneurs around the world that lack budgets to have everything on hand.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Use Case: Last Mile Communications</h2>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <p>There are a lot of communities that live “on the edge”. They are not served well by cloud providers because they are too far or too small for the large companies to serve them well with good Internet services and high speeds. Some of these communities have started using Open Source solutions to provide their own communications using long range WiFi, and wireless mesh technologies and local servers. However using a centralized cloud model means that much of their data has to travel outside of the community to the centralized cloud taxing the bandwidth of the backbone connection to the Internet, driving up their communication costs and increasing the latency of their Internet responses. Despite the “world-wide” aspects of the “World-Wide-Web”, a lot of the data and communications are done very locally.</p>
        <p>Subutai can give local people control of their cloud usage, allowing them to cache data locally in community clouds and execute applications on the edge, with Subutai’s intelligent management services making automatic decisions on where to execute programs and store data, decreasing the amount of systems administration overhead and making management easier.</p>
        <p>Subutai’s blueprints allow for local applications or application suites to be developed, suitable for the local community. Other types of high-bandwidth, low-latency applications would also work better in community clouds with relatively local servers such as VoIP and IP video conferencing.</p>
