        <p>The Subutai Blockchain Router is a power-efficient, “green” broadband Cloud router and open hardware IoT gateway. It serves as a plug-and-play cryptocurrency wallet and mining device that allows users to easily enter the cryptocurrency economy. Using just 18W (standalone; 60W with additional Mining Drives), the Subutai Blockchain Router is eco-friendly, cost-effective, and 1,000-2,000%+ more energy efficient for the same hash rate over traditional GPU-based mining devices —a critically important consideration in today’s energy-aware environment.</p>

        <h3>Revenue Generating</h3>
        <p>Beyond its advanced network functions, the Subutai Blockchain Router’s features benefit those telcos and ISPs who offer Subutai to their Internet subscribers. Users simply plug-and-mine cryptocurrency with no special technical skills needed. The device provides users a passive income of up to ~$125 USD worth of Ethereum-based tokens per month (at current depressed rates). The Router also provides a simple interface for users to easily select different coins to mine.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>No Wallet Confusion</h3>
        <p>The Router’s defense-grade hardware secured wallet with detachable Trusted Platform Module (TPM) eliminates software wallet confusion, and can be swapped into a new router in minutes to facilitate the RMA process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>On-the-Go Mobile Access</h3>
        <p>The Subutai Blockchain Router provides users with a “personal ATM at home”. When needing to transact rapidly on the go, mobile integrations allow users to securely connect, manage, and transact with their router wallet’s funds protected by the router’s enhanced security.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>Easily Enter the Sharing Economy</h3>
        <p>The Subutai Blockchain Router v2.0 comes pre-installed with Subutai tuned and hardware accelerated version of Subutai’s PeerOS. Users of the Blockchain Router can easily register with the Subutai Bazaar —“The Airbnb of Cloud and IoT Computing Resources”— to quickly list, share, and sell compute resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>Extensible</h3>
        <p>As a flexible IoT gateway, the Blockchain Router allows devices on the edge to be securely and efficiently connected to cloud applications. Subutai treats the cloud and the fog as one and the same, in a single continuum, to prevent unnecessary round-trip device communication with servers in data centers from impacting performance and security. As a multifunction device it can be configured to be a media center, a home/industrial automation and security system, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>Secure</h3>
        <p>Highly adaptive, the Blockchain Router’s security and performance-accelerated firmware dynamically changes its configuration to respond to usage behavior and to any potential threats encountered. Dynamic hardware acceleration maintains the device can alter its circuitry as a field programmable device even years after purchasing the device. The Router optimizes performance and provides additional security capabilities by filtering network packets at line rate. It analyzes traffic patterns to detect performance bottlenecks, potential security threats, and immediately deploy counter-measures. Hardware accelerating these functions using SDN and NFV, the router enables the main CPU to remain focused on its core routing functions and multifunctions users configure it for.</p>

        <h3>Add New Functionality</h3>
        <p>Beyond the Blockchain Router’s field programmable aspects, entirely new functionality can be added by attaching shields for Arduinos and Raspberry Pi devices. Anything from a detector, to a motor controller, or even a peripheral connect bus can be added to create IoT applications limited only by the imagination.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textBlock">
        <h3>High Speed Storage</h3>
        <p>The Router’s high speed flash-based storage can exceed the speeds of most SATA-III drives. It can be used as network attached storage (NAS) device or a high speed digital recorder. The storage can be increased and accelerated by adding more flash storage (eMMC) modules to the device. The Blockchain Router can apply several RAID levels across these eMMC modules.</p>
